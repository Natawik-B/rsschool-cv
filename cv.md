## Information about myself
I am 29 years old. I have been working in the insurance industry for 8 years. I'm constantly faced with the development of new products and various programs. Basically, of course, I act as a customer, but it's time to feel on the other side of development and feel the beauty of writing code. That’s why I’ve decided to try something new (rs school).
